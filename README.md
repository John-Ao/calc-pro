# Calc Pro
> Calc Pro written in different languages

## Overview
The Calc Pro Project is meant to be something more than a simple calculator. Actually, it's a small interpreter that supports varible and function definition.

There are many interesting things you can do with Calc Pro. Here are a few examples.

### Fibonacci
Type in the following lines and see the results for yourself:
```
f(x)=f(x-1)+f(x-2)
f(1)=1
f(2)=1
f(10)
```
Yes, just that simple. You just defined an iterate function, given the initial values and asked for the value of f(10).

### Power Function
It's really easy to define functions and solve them in Calc Pro. You can define functions with multiple varibles too.
```
power(x,y)=power(x,y-1)*x
power(x,0)=1
power(2,10)
```


Have fun!
