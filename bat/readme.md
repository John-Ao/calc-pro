# Calc Pro - Bat
> Written with Windows batch file.

It's known that bat only supports int type. The full edition includes scientific calculations while the standard edition doesn't. The trade-off, however, is that full edition is much slower. You can improve the efficience by editing the scientific calculation modules.

Anyway, these two batch file basically achieve the same functions as the python file.
